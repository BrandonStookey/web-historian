# Web-historian

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor Remote Beta. This project was worked on with a pair. Web-historian allow users to submit a URL, and archive it (by getting a copy of that website off of the internet and writing it to a local text file) and then it shows the user the copied text file.
